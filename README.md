### 🏆 Achievements 🏆

Some might call these "achievements," but I just call it validation.

* **Olympiad of Innovation and Digital Creativity** (infoeducatie.ro): Managed to get **2nd place three times** and one **mention** at the national level. Because why win when you can be consistently, gloriously second?
* **National Informatics Olympiad** (Algorithms): Proved I could out-think the competition by securing **2nd place at the county level twice**. My prize? More algorithms.
