UBB Cluj-Napoca CS Student // My mission is simple: to prove I'm more useful than a **well-trained Roomba.** ðŸ¤–
 
I'm currently engaged in advanced research on **distributed systems** and the art of **process automation**, primarily to validate my hypothesis that less work is better. I'm exceptionally good at it (read: lazy). ðŸ˜´

My toolkit for creating impactful user experiences includes **Next.js**, **tRPC**, and **PostgreSQL**â€”because apparently, people want to see things on the internet, and I'm here to facilitate. ðŸ’»

My true passion is **digital minimalism** and breaking things to see how they tick. I'm also currently acquiring critical wizardry skills in **Linear Algebra**, **Calculus**, and **Group Theory** to prepare for future magical endeavors. âœ¨
